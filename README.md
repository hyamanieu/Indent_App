# Indent_App
Load, visualize and analyze data obtained from nanoindentation.
# Install
In order to use the application, you can simply download Indent_App.mlappinstall. Within Matlab (2013a or above), head to APPS > Install App and select the mlappinstall file. It will be added to your list of MATLAB apps.

If you prefer using the application without the apps manager of Matlab, download all the *.m files and start IndentGUI_nested.m.
